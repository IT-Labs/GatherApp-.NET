## Introduction

This application is the back-end part of GatherApp project that enables employees to create a variety of events, differing in theme, location, type, and guest list both on behalf of the company and the employee as an individual. The front-end part of this project can be found on this link **[here](https://github.com/IT-Labs/GatherApp-UI)**.

## Technologies

This application uses .NET 8 Web API project that uses Entity Framework 8.0.1 to communicate with PostgreSQL DB. The database will be automatically created by setting the **ConnectionStrings** in **appsettings.Development.json** file. Then, execute the EF migrations with **update-database** in Package Manager Console. The repository already contains Azure Pipeline script that can be used for setting up CI/CD on Azure DevOps. The application uses custom JWT tokens for authentication/authorization. The SQL Server RDBMS should be used, and the application will use self-issued JWT tokens for authentication/authorization. Swagger is used for application documentation.

## Setup

- Install PostgreSQL server locally
- Clone Repository from Git
- Open the solution in Visual Studio 2023
- In appsettings.Development.json file add the following properties:
  - ConnectionStrings:
    - WebApiDatabase: Connection string to the local database.
  - EmailSettings:
    - Host: SMTP host for sending emails.
    - Username: Username for email authentication.
    - Password: Password for email authentication.
    - EnableSsl: Indicates whether SSL should be enabled for email communication.

    - ResetPasswordUrl: URL for resetting passwords.
    - ServerUrl: URL of the API server.
  - BlobStorageSettings:
